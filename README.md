# excel-is-a-physics-engine

This was a fun, silly little project I did a few years back when I was learning how to program in VBA to write Excel macros for my job at the time. There wasn't much work to be done in the first month or so of my employment (with an employer that will remain nameless) so I wanted to test the limits of what I could do with Excel macros. Basically, I turned the cells of the spreadsheet into pixels and drew elaborate shapes with code - an Archimedean spiral, projectile motion, even a rainbow. The final pièce de résistance was a "gravity simulator" that implemented the vector form of Newton's law of universal gravitation, and I was able to tweak the parameters in such a way that simulated an earth/moon/sun-like system.
